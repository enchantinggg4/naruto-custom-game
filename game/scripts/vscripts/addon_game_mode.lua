--[[
  This function is used to precache resources/units/items/abilities that will be needed
  for sure in your game and that will not be precached by hero selection.  When a hero
  is selected from the hero selection screen, the game will precache that hero's assets,
  any equipped cosmetics, and perform the data-driven precaching defined in that hero's
  precache{} block, as well as the precache{} block for any equipped abilities.

  See GameMode:PostLoadPrecache() in gamemode.lua for more information
